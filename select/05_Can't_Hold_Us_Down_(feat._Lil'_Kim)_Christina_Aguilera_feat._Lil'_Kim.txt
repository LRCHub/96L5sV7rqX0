Hmm
Hmm
Say
What am I not supposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back
Suddenly the target don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world
(Around the world)
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth, ohh
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
Ohh
So what do we do girls, shout louder
Lettin 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Whoaa
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down

Never can, never will...

So
What am I not supposed to say what I'm saying?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing

If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's OK
The guy can get away with it the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make it change
And start a new beginning for us
Everybody sang

This is for my girls all around the world
(Around the world)
Yeah
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
(Repect your worth)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
(Can't get rid of us)
So what do we do girls, shout louder
Lettin 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
(We're standing our ground)

So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down
Check

Now here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, or sex her off
But if a girl do the same, she's a whore

But the tables about to turn
I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas, and put they name on it
It's aight though, you can't hold me down
(Hold me)
I got to keep on moving
To my girls to their man who be trying to mac
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And LiL' Kim and Christina Aguilera got Yo back

Your just a little boy
Think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things
You're just a little boy
All you do is annoy
You must talk so big
To make up for smaller things

(This is for my girls)
This is for my girls all around the world, ohh
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth (spread your worth)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls, shout louder
Shout louder
Lettin 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (stand our ground)
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud

Never can, never will
Can't hold us down
This is for the girls all around the world
(All my girls)
Who have come across a man that don't respect
Your worth (around the world)

Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
Yeah
So what do we do girls, shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
(Stand our ground)
So lift your hands high and wave ' em proud
Ohh
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down
